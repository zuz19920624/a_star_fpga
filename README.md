# a_star_fpga
This project contains the software module for FPGA implementation of A* algorithm. This is an ongoing project and didn't end now!
The project is built by visual studio 2019 community version.
The software module is used for DSE of nodes cache and generating maps for FPGA tests
## test datasets
The test datasets are 0%-50% random maps @ 256x156
users can also put images for test, and the image should be named as "testmap.png"
